    <remarks>
      <para>
        FUSE permits userspace programs to implement a filesystem 
        interface, permitting any other userspace program to interact with the
        FUSE program as if it were a filesystem.  
        The <see cref="T:Mono.Fuse.FileSystem" /> type allows FUSE programs
        to be simply created from any managed language.
